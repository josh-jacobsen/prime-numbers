# Prime Numbers 

An application to take 2 numbers and calculate the prime numbers between the start and end value. 

### Running the application 

```
git clone https://github.com/josh-jacobsen/prime-numbers.git

cd prime-numbers 

yarn install

yarn start
```

A browser tab should open pointing at `http://localhost:3000/`

### Running the tests

2 test files have been included with some sample tests (test coverage is pretty sparse; with additional time the plan would be to add a lot more).

To run the tests, navigate to the root directory and run `yarn test`
